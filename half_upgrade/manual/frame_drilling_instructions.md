# Prusa i3 Bear Half Upgrade

## Frame Drilling Instructions

With this upgrade you will need to drill the original frame of your Prusa i3 MK2, MK2s or MK2.5.

I have made a [3D printed part](/half_upgrade/printed_parts/stl/drilling_helpers.stl) to help you place the holes accurately. You can double check the positions with [this PDF](/half_upgrade/doc/frame_drilling_dimensions.pdf).

As you will see in the bill of material, the recommended drill bit is a 5.3mm.

If you break the frame, you can send an email to Prusa support to get a new one. You will find few in the Chinese market as well.

If you have access to a CNC machine, you can use [the DXF here](/half_upgrade/optional_parts/alu_frame/).

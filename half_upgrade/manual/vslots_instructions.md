## V-Slots Instructions

This instructions are useful if you did not purchase pre-cut and pre-tap Openbuilds V-Slots

### Cutting

#### Machine cut

The best way to cut V-Slots is to use a mitre saw with special aluminum blade and lubricant.

Another way is to use a circular saw but you will need a cross-cut sled. As well as for mitre saw, a special aluminum blade and lubricant are necessary.

#### Hand cut

You can hand cut them accurately using a jig (it just takes more time and effort). I have build one, all details are here : https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2596242


### Tapping

You need to tap one side (two holes) of 195mm and 110mm V-Slots (8 holes in total). Thread needs to be 12mm deep (10mm usable) at least.

1. Apply lubricant on the tap and pour it into the hole
1. Make sure your tap is straight
1. Turn clockwise with a bit of pressure until it starts to be a bit harder, then reverse the rotation until you can feel a small detachment
1. Continue until you have a 20mm thread at least

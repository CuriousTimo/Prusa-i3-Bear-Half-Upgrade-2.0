#### Assembly

1. Check that the frame is not twisted by pressing down each corner (on the v-slots)
1. If it is twisted, place an object (in red on fig 6.1) under one corner and apply pressure simultaneously to both perpendicular corners (A and B). Repeat this for left and right side until you get a perfectly flat frame
1. Strongly tight frame screws and check others screws as well

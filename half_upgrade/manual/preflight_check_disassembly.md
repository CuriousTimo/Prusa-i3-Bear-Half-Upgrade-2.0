# Prusa i3 Bear Half Upgrade


## Preflight Check

1. Hardware parts correspond to [bom](bom.md)
1. Printed parts correspond to [bom](bom.md)
1. Verify visually all the printed parts to find defects and imperfections. Clean up if necessary.
1. Disassemble one z-axis-top of your printer and try the bear upgrade version by pushing the smooth rod in the corresponding hole. This helps you verify that your parts have been printed with good calibration. If it is too tight, use a file to increase hole
1. Verify positions of V-Slots holes on the frame with [this image](/half_upgrade/doc/vslots_length.png)
1. Verify your V-Slots' threads length with a screw (M5x20mm or longer), they should be 20mm long at least
1. I recommend to use thread locker like Loctite Blue 243 to secure screws during assembly (for metal thread to metal thread, not metal thread to plastic).
1. Maybe something is interesting for you in the [optional parts](/optional_parts.md)
 

## Disassembly recommendations

1. Prepare some containers to keep all you parts, screws, bolts, etc. from the original printer
1. Unload filament and remove spool holders
1. Unplug everything from the RAMBo board
1. Disassemble RAMBo cover and lid
1. Disassemble the Z axis and keep X axis in one piece (be careful with bearings)
1. Use a tape and marker to identify your Z rods
1. Identify your Z motors, one has shorter cables
1. Disassemble y-belt-idler and remove the belt from the Y motor
1. Finish to disassemble Y axis but keep Y carriage and heated bed in one piece (be careful with bearings)
1. Use a tape and marker to identify your Y rods
1. Disassemble the PSU
1. Disassemble the LCD support, keep only the LCD cover and electronics

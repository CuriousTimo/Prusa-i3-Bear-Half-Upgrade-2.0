This is the HALF version of the Prusa i3 Bear upgrade. An affordable upgrade to get a much stronger frame for your MK2, MK2s or MK2.5. If you would like to have an even stronger frame check out the [full upgrade version](/full_upgrade/) or spot the differences on the [home page](https://github.com/gregsaun/prusa_i3_bear_upgrade/).

* Compatible with MK2, MK2s and MK2.5
* Highly detailed manual

## Manual

The manual contains bill of material (bom), preparing frame and v-slots, print settings and assembly instructions.

[Read it here](manual/)


## Modify the original aluminum frame

With this upgrade you will need to drill the original frame of your Prusa i3 MK2, MK2s or MK2.5.

I have made a [3D printed part](printed_parts/stl/drilling_helpers.stl) to help you place the holes accurately. You can double check the positions with [this PDF](doc/frame_drilling_dimensions.pdf).

As you will see in the bill of material, the recommended drill bit is a 5.3mm.

If you break the frame, you can send an email to Prusa support to get a new one. You will find few in the Chinese market as well.

If you have access to a CNC machine, you can use [this DXF here](doc/alu_frame/).


## Purchase Openbuilds V-Slots

Here is a list of [Openbuilds stores](/doc/openbuilds_stores_list.md). Note that few stores are selling a pre-cut V-Slots.
